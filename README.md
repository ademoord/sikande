# sikande
The first ever Sikande website using Flask
------------------------------------------
Sikande, which stands for "Sistem Informasi Keuangan Andro dan Dewi" (means "Finance Information System of Andro and Dewi" in English), is a private website that, planned to, handle all activities of my financial-life with my wife (Dewi). It'll handle the cashflow entries, incomes, outcomes, debts and even the budgetting plan and stores the data in remote MySQL databases.

Soon, hopefully this website will also provide some tools for the needs of data analytics to address our overall financial issues, in syaa Allaah.
